# Maze generation and solver
Usage:
```
./main.py <maze size>
```
The application generates a maze and subsequently finds a path from the left top corner of the maze to the right bottom corner.
`matplotlib` is used to print the resulting maze and path on screen. 

## Maze generation
Right now, only a depth-first based generation algorithm has been implemented.

## Maze solving
Right now, only a depth-first based solving algorithm has been implemented.
